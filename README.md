# gradle-android-javadocs
Helps setup the tasks needed to generate javadocs for an Android library.
Derived from the [example](https://github.com/jitpack/android-example/blob/master/library/build.gradle) provided by the great guys as [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io)


# Usage
Add this line to the end of your library's `build.gradle` to get it producing Javadocs!
```java
apply from: 'https://raw.github.com/Commit451/gradle-android-javadocs/master/gradle-mvn-push.gradle'
```
